## [Unreleased]

### Added

-   Standard values of `Network` for testnet and mainnet, exposed as constants `TESTNET` and `MAINNET`.

### Changed

-   `WalletConnection` (breaking): Support both module and type/parameter schemas in `signAndSendTransaction`.
    To migrate existing usage, wrap the schema string in the new function `moduleSchemaFromBase64(...)`.
-   `WalletConnection` (breaking): Support both string and binary messages in `signMessage`.
    To migrate existing usage, wrap the message string in the new function `stringMessage(...)`.
-   `WalletConnection`: Deprecate the method `getJsonRpcClient` on `WalletConnection`
    in favor of the gRPC Web client `ConcordiumGRPCClient` for querying a Node via API version 2.
    The client should be managed independently of this library, e.g. using `useGrpcClient` in `@concordium/react-components`.
-   `Network`: Add field `grpcOpts` containing the initialization options for a gRPC Web client `ConcordiumGRPCClient` to connect to the given network.

### Changed
